[![](https://imagelayers.io/badge/petehouston/docker-alpine-php:latest.svg)](https://imagelayers.io/?images=petehouston/docker-alpine-php:latest 'Get your own badge on imagelayers.io')

A very small Docker image to bootstrap your PHP development.

### Why this image?

Of course, there are [official PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) but the size looks a little big for my development machine, and I also prefer some customization on my builds.

In addition, I sometimes want to quickly run a small PHP script, so I don't really need that big-in-size official images.

### Supported Versions

Following PHP versions are set as default

* [tag:7.0](7.0/Dockerfile) (7.0.6)
* [tag:5.6](5.6/Dockerfile) (5.6.21)
* [tag:5.5](5.5/Dockerfile) (5.5.25)

### How to use?

Just pull it to your local machine,

```
$ docker pull petehouston/docker-alpine-php
```
