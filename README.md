# Docker Alpine PHP

A very small Docker image to bootstrap your PHP development.

### Why this image?

Of course, there are [official PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) but the size looks a little big for my development machine, and I also prefer some customization on my builds.

In addition, I sometimes want to quickly run a small PHP script, so I don't really need that big-in-size official images.

### How to use?

Just pull it to your local machine,

```
$ docker pull petehouston/docker-alpine-php
```
